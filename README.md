Advanced Java

Problem 1.	Play with IntelliJ IDEA
Install Java 8 and IntelliJ IDEA. Start IntelliJ and play with it. Try to write some Java code. You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

Problem 2.	Empty Java Project in IntelliJ
Create a new Java project in IntelliJ called "Intro-Java-Homework". This project will hold all your homework files (Java source code). For each problem (exercise), add a separate Java class with self-descriptive name like "AssignVariables.java” or "PrintCharacters.java". You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

Problem 3.	Assign Variables
Find suitable types for variables. You are given the following types: byte, short, int, long, char, boolean, float, double, and String. Assign the following values to them false, “Palo Alto, CA”, 32767, 2000000000, 0.1234567891011, 0.5f, 919827112351L, 127, ‘c’. Try to assign 32768 to short and see what happens.

Problem 4.	 Print Characters
Print the characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’ on the console on a single line, separated by a space. Use a for-loop. Note: you can directly declare and increment char in the for-loop. for (char c = ‘a’; …)
Output
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

Problem 5.	* Print a Character Triangle
Create a triangle of characters, based on input. Learn about java.util.Scanner and Integer.parseInt (). Test your program with integers up to 26. Think why.

Problem 6.	 Sum numbers from 1 to N
Input	Output
12	78
Input	Output
1	1
 Create a Java program that reads a number N from the console and calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (inclusive).
Input	Output
5	15

Problem 7.	*Ghetto Numeral System
Input	Output
6781	DisHoodJamBro
9374	MackMaHoodDuh
533	YoMaMa
102	BroGeeZuz
 Write a program that converts the decimal number system to the ghetto numeral system. In the ghetto, numbers are represented as following:
	0 – Gee
	1 – Bro
	2 – Zuz
	3 – Ma
	4 – Duh	
	5  - Yo
	6 – Dis
	7 – Hood
	8 – Jam
	9 – Mack

Problem 8.	**Get Average
Create a method that finds the average of three numbers. Read in internet about java methods. Check the naming conventions. Invoke your method and test it. Format the output to two digits after the decimal separator. The placeholder is %.2f
a	b	c	Average
1.5	2.5	3.8	2.60
12	13	25	16.67
0.005	0.5	0.55	0.35
0	0	2	0.67
